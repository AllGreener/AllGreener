### A Token of the Color of Nature üëã


**By Claudio Olimpio** 

The post-industrial revolution world is marked by technological advances and economic development. But, over time, these terms ended up being associated with the exploitation of the environment. Often, with a certain reason, because between the gold rush in Brazil, in the 17th and 17th centuries, to web 4.0, there was much more concern with producing (regardless of how), than with caring for and preserving.

But this dynamic can change. We live in a moment of climate emergency in the world, in which the preservation of the environment guides dialogues, debates and industrial and/or economic production. ESG calls the shots for large companies, and it is no longer possible to think of psychological models designed exclusively to absorb and withdraw from the environment. One example is the arrival of the first electric cars on the market, in an increasingly dominant trend. With so many social actors fighting for improvements in the environment, in blockchain this movement could not be different.

To help preserve the environment and guarantee a financial asset to those involved, in what must be the fight of our century - the preservation of the planet and its natural resources -, in September, Dax Green launched the Greener - a green token whose main objective is to finance sustainable development and environmental preservation projects.

The token transcends the simple idea of a digital asset into a platform that offers companies the Greener Preservation Token (GPT). In the case of Greener, each GPT represents conservation services in the Amazon Forest already in progress. It also guarantees the preservation of 106 thousand hectares of native forests in the states of Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Par√° and Rond√¥nia, where more than 1,700 species of animals live in a vast biome.

It is much more than putting ESG in a company's marketing, Greener directly helps to avoid deforestation and forest degradation, causing companies to boost and become increasingly involved in this sustainable path, reducing the impact that was caused in the environment. All this, combined with a technology that places a ‚Äúsecurity layer‚Äù on the carbon asset, makes the process faster, safer and more traceable. And to formalize this transformation process, the investing company will receive a stamp and a certificate that will prove the compensation with the Greener.

A lesson that investing and thinking about the environment and sustainable means is to invest in the world, in society and, automatically, in development.###
